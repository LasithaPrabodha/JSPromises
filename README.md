### Javascript Promises by Example
 
 - In [app-synchronous](src/app-synchronous.js), a synchronous approach is used to calculate the sum of a large array, employing a loop with a time delay. 
 - [app-promise-with-httprequest](src/app-promise-with-httprequest.js) demonstrates asynchronous programming by fetching a random dog image URL using the XMLHttpRequest API and handling the response with Promises. 
 - [app-asynchronous](src/app-asynchronous.js) showcases asynchronous computation using Promises and setTimeout to perform the sum calculation in chunks while allowing other tasks to execute.
